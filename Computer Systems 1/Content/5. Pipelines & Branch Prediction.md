## Branch Prediction
Branch prediction is a technique used to improve the performance of pipelined processors. Pipelines aim to complete one instruction every clock cycle by overlapping the steps of instruction execution (fetch, decode, calculate operands, fetch operands, execute instruction, and write/complete result). However, branches can cause "pipeline stalls" because the processor fetches the wrong instructions when it encounters a branch.
