## Branch Prediction
Branch prediction is a technique used to improve the performance of pipelined processors. 

Pipelines aim to complete one instruction every clock cycle by overlapping the steps of instruction execution (fetch, decode, calculate operands, fetch operands, execute instruction, and write/complete result).

However, branches can cause "pipeline stalls" because the processor fetches the wrong instructions when it encounters a branch.

Branch prediction units try to guess which branch will be taken, so that the processor can fetch the correct instructions and avoid stalls.
There are various methods of branch prediction:
- **Static branch prediction** makes a fixed prediction about whether a branch will be taken. One simple approach is to predict that a branch will never be taken, always fetching the next instruction.
