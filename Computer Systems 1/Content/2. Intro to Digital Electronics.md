## Combinatorial Circuits
Interconnected set of gates whose output at any time is a function only of the input at that time.
Consists of $n$ binary inputs and $m$ binary outputs. Can be defined in 3 ways:
- **Truth Table:** For each of the $2^{n}$ possible combinations of input signals, the binary value of each of the $m$ output signals is listed.
- **Graphical Symbols:** The interconnected layout of gates is depicted
- **Boolean Equations:** Each output signal is expressed as a Boolean function of its input signals.

## Boolean Equations (in Logic Notation)
To write logic easily, $+$, $\bullet$  and  $\bar{}$  are used for OR/AND
$C = A + B$  means A OR B
$C = A \bullet B$   means A AND B
$A = \bar{B}$            means NOT B
Not is sometimes typed as $/B$ or $\neg$

## How logic relates to electronics
$0$ is usually $0$ Volts ( but really means "low" Voltage )
$1$ is usually power supply voltage ( but really means "high" Voltage )
