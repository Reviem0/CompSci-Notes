A set is a collection of objects

The objects are sometimes referred to as elements or members

If a set is finite and not too large we can describe it by listing the elements in it. For example:

$$
A = \{0,1,8\}
$$
Sets are usually specified with curly braces
- $\{0,1\}$ is the set with elements 0 and 1
Order of elements is not important
- $\{0,1\}$ and $\{1,0\}$ denote the same set
Multiplicity of elements is not important
- $\{0,1, 0\}$ and $\{0,1\}$ denote the same set
We sometimes use dots as shorthand
- $\{0,1,...,9\}$ and $\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$
Dots are sometimes used as shorthand for infinitely many elements
- $\{0,1,2,...\}$ is a set of positive integers
- $\{0,2,4,...\}$ is a set of even numbers

## Membership
When an element $x$ is in a set $X$ we write $x \in X$
When an element is **not** in a set $X$ we write $y \not\in X$
- $A \in \{ b,a,c \}$
- $0 \in \{ 0,1 \}$
- $i \not\in \{ t,e,a,m \}$

## Cardinality (Of finite sets)
For finite set, write $|X|$ for the number of elements of $X$
This is the cardinality of $X$

$$|\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}| = 10$$
$$
\displaylines
{
|a,b,a,c| = 3 \\
\text{This set has a cardinality of 3 because it has 3 unique elements $\{ a,b,c \}$}
}
$$



## Other Sets from Maths
$\mathbb{N} = \{0,1,2,...\}$ the **natural** numbers
$\mathbb{Z} = \{...,-2,-1,0,1,2,...\}$ the integers
$\mathbb{R}$ the reals
$\mathbb{C}$ the complex numbers

All these are examples of infinite sets
## Empty Set
If a set does not contain any elements it is called the empty set and is usually denoted $\emptyset$

$$|\emptyset| = 0 $$
## Elements of Different Types
A set may contain any kind of elements whatsoever
eg.
$$\{4.5, George, \pi, 14\}$$
A set may contain elements that are themselves sets
$$\{3,\{5,1\}, 12, \{\pi, 4.5, 40, 16\}\}$$
