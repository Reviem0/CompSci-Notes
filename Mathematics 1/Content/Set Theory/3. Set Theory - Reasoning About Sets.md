## Subset Relation

A set $X$ is a subset of $Y$ when every element of $X$ is also an element of $Y$
$$X\subseteq Y$$

- Every set satisfies $X \subset X$
- For any set $X$ we have $\emptyset \subset X$
We write $X \subset Y$ to mean that $X \subseteq Y$ and there exists $y \in Y$ and $y \not\in X$

To show that sets $X$ and $Y$ are equal is is enough to show:
$$
X \subseteq Y
$$
$$
Y \subseteq X
$$
## Products and sums of sets
### Ordered Pairs
We know that:
$$
\{0,1\} = \{1,0\}
$$
However, for an ordered pair we can write $(0,1)$
$$
(0,1) \neq (1,0)
$$

### Cartesian Product
If $X$ and $Y$ are sets $X \times Y$ denotes the set of all ordered pairs:
$$
X \times Y = \{(x,y)|x \in X ~ \& ~ y \in Y\}
$$
Eg:
$$
\{0,1\} \times \{1,0\} = (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)
$$
