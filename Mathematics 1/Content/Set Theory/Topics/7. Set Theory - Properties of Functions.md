## Injective Functions
A function $f:X\to Y$ is **injective** (one-to-one) if it satisfies the following condition
- for all $x$, $x'$ in $X$, $f(x')$ implies that $x = x'$
- so different elements are mapped to different elements and no element  $x \in X$ is mapped to an element $Y$ more than once

In this case the first is **injective** as all elements in $X$ are mapped to different element in $Y$
Second is *NOT* **injective** as two elements in $X$ are mapped to a single element in $Y$ 
## Surjective Functions
A function $f: X\to Y$ is **surjective** (onto) if for all $y \in Y$ there exists an $x \in X$ such that $f(x) = y$
In other words, $f$ is **surjective** if its range is all of $Y$

In this case, the first is **surjective** as all elements in $Y$ are being mapped to by the $f$ .
Second is *NOT* **sur**
