## Definition and Notation
Definitions:
1. A **relation** from $X$ to $Y$ is a subset $R \subseteq X\times Y$
2. A **relation** on a set $X$ is a relation from $X$ to $X_{i}$ such that $R \subseteq X\times X_{i}$
Notation:
	Let $R$ be a relation, instead of saying $(x,y) \in R$ to say elements $x$ and $y$ are related through $R$, we use $\sim$ where $(\sim \subseteq X\times X)$.
	The **âˆ€** symbol is used to mean **for all**.
		e.g. $\forall x \in X$ means for all elements $x$ in $X$
## Types of Relation
Let $R$ be a relation on $X$:
- $R$ is **reflexive** if $\forall x \in X, x\sim x$ 
	- $R$ is reflexive if all elements $x \in X$ can relate to themselves through the relation $R$
	- i.e. $\forall x \in X, (x,x)\subseteq R$
- $R$ is **symmetric** if $\forall x,y \in X, \text{if}~x\sim y~\text{then}~y\sim x$
	- $R$ is symmetric if for all elements $x \in X$ that relate to $y \in X$ through $R$, $y$ can also relate to $x$ through $R$
	- i.e. $\forall x,y \in X$, if $(x,y) \in R$ exists, then $(y,x)\in R$ must also exist
-  $R$ is **transitive** if $\forall x,y,z \in X,\text{if}~x\sim y~\text{and}~y\sim z~\text{then}~x\sim z$
	- $R$ is transitive if for all elements $x,y,z \in X$ if $x$ relates to $y$ and $y$ relates to $z$ then $x$ must also relate to $z$
- $R$ is an **equivalence relation** if it's *reflexive, symmetric* and *transitive*
### Examples
#### Ex 1
$S = \{ \text{all people} \}$
$R = \{ (x,y)|x \in S~\text{and}~y\in S~\text{have the same parents}\}$
- $R$ is **reflexive** as for all $x \in S$, $x$ must have the same name as itself
	- $\forall x \in X,(x,x)\subseteq R$ exists
- $R$ is **symmetric** as for all $x,y \in S$ if $x$ has the same name as $y$ then $y$ must have the same name as $x$
- $R$ is **transitive** as for all $x,y,z \in S$ if $x$ has the same name as $y$ and $y$ has the same name as $z$, then $x$ must have the same name as $z$
Hence, the relation $R$ is an **equivalence relation**

#### Ex 2
$S = \mathbb{R}$
$R = \{ (x,y)|x \in S~\text{and}~y \in S~\text{where}~x>y \}$
- $R$ is not **reflexive** as $x\not>x$
	- Hence $\forall x \in X, (x,x) \not \subseteq R$
- $R$ is not **symmetric** as if $x>y$ then $y \not>x$
- $R$ is **transitive** as if $x>y$ and $y>z$ then $x > z$
Hence, the relation $R$ is not an **equivalence relation**

## Equivalence Classes
An **equivalence class** is a subset of elements that are all related to each other under a given equivalence relation. 

If we have an equivalence $R$ on a set $S$, then the equivalence class of an element $a \in S$, denoted $[a]$, is defined as:
$$
[a] = \{ x \in S~|~(a,x) \in R \}
$$

*OR*

If $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on $X$ and $a \in X$ then the **equivalence class** of $a$ is the set
$$
[a] = \{ x|x \in X~\text{and}~x\sim a \}
$$

$X/\sim = \{ [x]~|~x \in X \}$ is the set all equivalence classes
### Example
Consider the set $S = \{ 1,2,3,4,5,6 \}$ and an equivalence relation $R$ defined as 'having the same remainder when divided by 3
$S = \{ 1,2,3,4,5,6 \}$
$R = \{(x,y)~|~x \in S, y \in S, x~\text{and}~y~\text{have the same remainder when divided by 3} \}$
For this relation:
 - $[1] = \{ 1,4 \}$
	- The equivalence class of $1, [1]$, includes all elements that give the same remainder as $1$ when divided by $3$ (i.e. $3\%1 = 1$ - Hence, all elements that have a remainder of $1$ when divided by $3$).
- $[2] = \{ 2,5 \}$
- $[3] = \{ 3,6 \}$
etc...
## Partition
A **partition** of a set is a way of dividing the set into distinct, non-overlapping subsets that together cover the entire set. Each subset in a **partition** is called a *part* or *block* of the **partition**. Partitions are useful for organising a set into smaller, meaningful subsets where each element of the set belongs to exactly one subset,
A collection $X_{1},\dots,X_{n}$ of subsets of $X$ is a **partition** of a set $X$ when
$$
X_{1} \cup \dots \cup X_{n} = X
$$
for all $1 \leq i,j\leq n,i\not=j$ implies that $X_{i}\cap x_{j} = \emptyset$
