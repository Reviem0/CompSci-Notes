## Definition and Notation
Definitions:
1. A **relation** from $X$ to $Y$ is a subset $R \subseteq X\times Y$
2. A **relation** on a set $X$ is a relation from $X$ to $X_{i}$ such that $R \subseteq X\times X_{i}$
Notation:
	Let $R$ be a relation, instead of saying $(x,y) \in R$ to say elements $x$ and $y$ are related through $R$, we use $\sim$ where $(\sim \subseteq X\times X)$.
	The **âˆ€** symbol is used to mean **for all**.
		e.g. $\forall x \in X$ means for all elements $x$ in $X$
## Types of Relation
Let $R$ be a relation on $X$:
- $R$ is **reflexive** if $\forall x \in X, x\sim x$ 
	- $R$ is reflexive if all elements $x \in X$ can relate to themselves through the relation $R$
	- i.e. $\forall x \in X, (x,x)\subseteq R$
- $R$ is **symmetric** if $\forall x,y \in X, \text{if}~x\sim y~\text{then}~y\sim x$
	- $R$ is symmetric if for all elements $x \in X$ that relate to $y \in X$ through $R$, $y$ can also relate to $x$ through $R$
	- i.e. $\forall x,y \in X$, if $(x,y) \in R$ exists, then $(y,x)\in R$ must also exist
-  $R$ is **transitive** if $\forall x,y,z \in X,\text{if}~x\sim y~\text{and}~y\sim z~\text{then}~x\sim z$
	- $R$ is transitive if for all elements $x,y,z \in X$ if $x$ relates to $y$ and $y$ relates to $z$ then $x$ must also relate to $z$
- $R$ is an **equivalence relation** if it's *reflexive, symmetric* and *transitive*
## Examples
### Ex 1
$S = \{ \text{all people} \}$
$R = \{ (x,y)|x \in S~\text{and}~y\in S~\text{have the same parents}\}$
- $R$ is **reflexive** as for all $x \in S$, $x$ must have the same name as itself
	- $\forall x \in X,(x,x)\subseteq R$ exists
- $R$ is **symmetric** as for all $x,y \in S$ if $x$ has the same name as $y$ then $y$ must have the same name as $x$
- $R$ is **transitive** as for all $x,y,z \in S$ if $x$ has the same name as $y$ and $y$ has the same name as $z$, then $x$ must have the same name as $z$
Hence, the relation $R$ is an **equivalence relation**

### Ex 2
$S = \mathbb{R}$
$R = \{ (x,y)|x \in S~\text{and}~y \in S~\text{where}~x>y \}$
- $R$ is not **reflexive** as $x\not>x$
	- Hence $\forall x \in X, (x,x) \not \subseteq R$
- $R$ is not **symmetric** as if $x>y$ then $y \not>x$
- $R$ is **transitive** as if $x>y$ and $y>z$ then $x > z$
Hence, the relation $R$ is not an **equivalence relation**

## Equivalence Classes
if $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on $X$ and $a \in X$ then the **equivalence class** of $a$ is the set
