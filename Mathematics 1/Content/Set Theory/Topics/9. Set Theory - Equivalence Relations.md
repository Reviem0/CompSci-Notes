## Definition and Notation
Definitions:
1. A **relation** from $X$ to $Y$ is a subset $R \subseteq X\times Y$
2. A **relation** on a set $X$ is a relation from $X$ to $X_{i}$ such that $R \subseteq X\times X_{i}$
Notation:
	Let $R$ be a relation, instead of saying $(x,y) \in R$ to say elements $x$ and $y$ are related through $R$, we use $\sim$ where $(\sim \subseteq X\times X)$.
## Types of Relation
Let $R$ be a relation on $X$:
- $R$ is **reflexive** if $\forall x \in X, x\sim x$ 
	- $R$ is reflexive if all elements in $R$ can relate to each other through the relation $R$
	- i.e. $\forall x \in X, (x,x)\subseteq R$
	- all elements
