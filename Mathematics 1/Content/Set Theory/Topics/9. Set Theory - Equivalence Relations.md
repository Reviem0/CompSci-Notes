## Definition and Notation
Definitions:
1. A **relation** from $X$ to $Y$ is a subset $R \subseteq X\times Y$
2. A **relation** on a set $X$ is a relation from $X$ to $X_{i}$ i.e. 
Let $R$ be a relation, instead of saying $(x,y) \in R$ to say elements $x$ and $y$ are related through $R$, we use $\sim$ where $(\sim \subseteq X\times X)$.
