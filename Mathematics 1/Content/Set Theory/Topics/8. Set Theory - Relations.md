## Relation Between Sets
Recall the [[4. Set Theory - Products and Sums of Sets#Cartesian Product|Cartesian Product]]
![[4. Set Theory - Products and Sums of Sets#Cartesian Product]]
A **binary** relation $R$ from $X$ to $Y$ is **some** set of ordered pairs $(x,y)$ with $x \in X$ and $y \in Y$
- In other words, a subset of the [[4. Set Theory - Products and Sums of Sets#Cartesian Product|Cartesian Product]] $X\times Y$
- i.e. $R \subseteq X\times Y$
We will use $R,S,T$ to denote relations
Given finite sets $X$ and $Y$, there are $|X| \times |Y|$ relations

## Examples of Relations
When $X=Y$, instead of saying that $R$ is a relation from $X$ to $X$, we usually say that $R$ is a relation **on** $X$
