Recall the [[4. Set Theory - Products and Sums of Sets#Cartesian Product|Cartesian Product]]
![[4. Set Theory - Products and Sums of Sets#Cartesian Product]]
A **binary** relation $R$ from $X$ to $Y$ is **some** set of ordered pairs $(x,y)$ with $x \in X$ and $y \in Y$
- In other words, a subset of the [[4. Set Theory - Products and Sums of Sets#Cartesian Product|Cartesian Product]] $X\times Y$
- i.e. $R \subseteq X\times Y$
