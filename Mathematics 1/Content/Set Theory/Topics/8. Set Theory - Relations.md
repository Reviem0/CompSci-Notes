## Relation Between Sets
Recall the [[4. Set Theory - Products and Sums of Sets#Cartesian Product|Cartesian Product]]
![[4. Set Theory - Products and Sums of Sets#Cartesian Product]]
A **binary** relation $R$ from $X$ to $Y$ is **some** set of ordered pairs $(x,y)$ with $x \in X$ and $y \in Y$
- In other words, a subset of the [[4. Set Theory - Products and Sums of Sets#Cartesian Product|Cartesian Product]] $X\times Y$
- i.e. $R \subseteq X\times Y$
We will use $R,S,T$ to denote relations
Given finite sets $X$ and $Y$, there are $|X| \times |Y|$ relations

## Examples of Relations
When $X=Y$, instead of saying that $R$ is a relation from $X$ to $X$, we usually say that $R$ is a relation **on** $X$ 

Examples:
- The full relation $X\times Y$, the empty relation $\emptyset \subseteq X\times Y$
- There is a relation on any set $X$ called the *identity* relation
	- $I_{X}=\{ (x,x)|x \in X \}$
## Digraphs
A *directed graph* (**digraph**) with at most one edge from one vertex to another can be formalised as a binary relation on its set of vertices

## Composition of Relations
if $R$ is a relation from $X$ to $Y$ and $S$ is a relation from $Y$ to $Z$ then $R;S$ is a relation from $X$ to $Z$ defined:
- $(x,z) \in R;S$ if there exists $y \in Y$ such that $(x,y)\in R$ and $(y,z)\in S$
- $R;S$ is sometimes written as $S \circ R$
- composition is associative

## Functions are Special Relations
Any function $f:X \to Y$ is a special kind of relation from $X$ to $Y$ that satisfies:
- for all $x \in X$ there **exists a unique** $y\in Y$ such that $(x,y)\in f$ 
	- i.e. for all $x \in X$ there exists $y\in Y$ such that $(x,y)\in f$ 
	- if $(x,y)\in f$ and $(x,z)\in f$ then $y=z$ 
Given a function $f$, then we want to emphasise that we are talking about the relation, we call it the **graph of** $f$

Composition of function is a *special case* of composition of relations
