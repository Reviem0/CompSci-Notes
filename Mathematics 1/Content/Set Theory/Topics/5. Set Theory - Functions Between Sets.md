## Notation
We use $f,g,h$  to denote functions
A function $f$ from set $X$ to set $Y$ is usually written $f:X \to Y$
$f:X \to Y$
- $X$ is called the **domain**
- $Y$ is called the **codomain**
- we write $f(x)=y$  to mean that the value of $f$ at $x$ is $y$
Functions $f:X \to Y$ and $g:X \to Y$ are **equal** exactly when they "behave the same" on all elements of $X$:
- for all $x \in X$ we have $f(x)=g(x)$
## Range
The **range** of a function $f: X \to Y$ is the largest subset $R \subseteq Y$ that satisfies the following property:
- for all $r \in R$  there exists $x \in X$ such that $f(x) =r$
In other words, the range is those elements of $Y$ that are "mapped to" by $f$

## Functions of Several Variables
A function of several variable is nothing but a function with a domain as a cartesian product of sets:
Eg.
Standard operations such as addition, multiplication etc. can be considered functions such as:
**Addition**
$+: \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to N$
The function $+$ takes two natural numbers and produces one natural number
The domain is any ordered pair of natural numbers $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ such as (0,1),(2,3)(5,8) and the codomain is any single natural number.
For example:
$+: (4,6) \to 10$
or 
$+: X \to 10$
where $X = (4,6)$

This follows the same notation as any other function such as 
$f:X \to Y$

Q. Which of the following are functions $R \to R$ ? 
- $f(x) = x^2$
- $f(x) = 0$
- $f(x,y) = x+y$
- f(x) =
