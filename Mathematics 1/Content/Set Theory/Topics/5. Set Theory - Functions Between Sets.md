## Notation
We use $f,g,h$  to denote functions
A function $f$ from set $X$ to set $Y$ is usually written $f:X \to Y$
$f:X \to Y$
- $X$ is called the **domain**
- $Y$ is called the **codomain**
- we write $f(x)=y$  to mean that the value of $f$ at $x$ is $y$
Functions $f:X \to Y$ and $g:X \to Y$ are **equal** exactly when they "behave the same" on all elements of $X$:
- for all $x \in X$ we have $f(x)=g(x)$
