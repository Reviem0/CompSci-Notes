## Orders
We all know that $0\leq 1,4 \leq56$, and $3 \leq \pi \leq 4$

The order symbol is actually a relation:
$$
\leq_{\mathbb{N}} = \{ (p,q)|p,q\in \mathbb{N},\exists r\in \mathbb{N}. q=p+r \}
$$
In layman terms, this means that $\leq$ is defined as: 
- for elements $p$ and $q$ in $\mathbb{N}$, there exists ($\exists$) an element $r$ in $\mathbb{N}$ such that $q = p+r$
## Partial Orders
A **partial older** on a set $P$ is a relation that is [[9. Set Theory - Equivalence Relations#Types of Relation|Reflexive]], [[9. Set Theory - Equivalence Relations#Types of Relation|Transitive]] and [[9. Set Theory - Equivalence Relations#Types of Relation|Anti-symmetric]]. It allows for a structured way to compare elements.

### Example 1
A relation  $\leq \subseteq X \times X$ is a partial order as it is:
- Reflexive - $\forall x \in X, x\leq x$
-  Transitive - $\forall x,y,z \in X, x\leq y$ and $x\leq z$ imply $x\leq z$
- Anti-symmetric - $\forall x,y \in X$ if $x\leq y$ and $y\leq x$ then $x=y$
### Example 2
Another example of a partial order is the **subset relation** ($\subseteq$) on the powerset of a set $S$

For $\subseteq$ on $P(S)$
- Reflexive - Every subset $A \subseteq A$
- Transitive - if $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq C$ then $A sub-=$
