## Orders
We all know that $0\leq 1,4 \leq56$, and $3 \leq \pi \leq 4$
The order symbol is actually a relation:
$$
\leq_{\mathbb{N}} = \{ (p,q)|p,q\in \mathbb{N},\exists r\in \mathbb{N}. q=p+r \}
$$
In layman terms, this means for elements $p$ and $q$ in the natural numbers, there exists($\exists$) an element $r$ such that $q = p+r$
