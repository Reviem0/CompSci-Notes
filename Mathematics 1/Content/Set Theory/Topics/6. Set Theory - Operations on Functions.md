## Composition
If $f: X \to Y$ and $g:Y\to Z$  then $f;g:X\to Z$ is a function that is defined
- $(f;g)(x) = g(f(x))$
- $f;g$ is sometimes written  $g \circ f$

## Associativity
Function composition is associative $(f;g);h = f;(g;h)$
Proof:
- Let's consider three functions $f,g,h$
- Let $x$ be any element in the domain of
