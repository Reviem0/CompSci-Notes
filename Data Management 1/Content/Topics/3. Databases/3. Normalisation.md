Normalisation is a process to avoid anomalies
It improves:
- Efficiency
- Maintenance
- Size

This is done by dividing the database into multiple tables and defining relationships between them

## Steps to Normalisation
- First normal form - atomicity, find keys
- Second normal form - remove partial dependencies
	- Non-Key attributes must depend on every part of the primary key
- Third normal form: remove transitive dependencies
	- No non-key attributes depend on another non-key attribute
- Boyce-Codd normal form: Stricter than 3NF
	- Every attribute must be a fact about a key

### Step 1: Select a primary key
We need to find the candidate keys:
- An attribute or combination of attributes that uniquely identifies a row
- A candidate key is always determinant
- Candidate keys are a special case of determinant

Each candidate key can qualify as a primary key
- We then select the best from the options
