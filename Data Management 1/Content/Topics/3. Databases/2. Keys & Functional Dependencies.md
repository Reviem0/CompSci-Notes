## Keys
A set of attributes forms a key for a relation if we do not allow two different tuples in a relation instance to have the same values in all the attributes of the key

## Functional Dependecies
Let a relation with schema $R(A_{1},\dots,A_{n},B_{1},B_{2},\dots,B_{m})$ and let $r$ be an instance of $R$

We say that $r$ satisfies the functional dependency $A_{1},\dots,A_{n} \to B_{1},B_{2},\dots,B_{m}$ if whenever two tuples in $r$ agree on the values of $A_{1},\dots,A_{n}$, then they also agree on the values of $B_{1},B_{2},\dots B_{m}$

In other words there are no two tuples in r that have the same value on the attributes of $A_{1,}$
