## What is an OS?

- Enables computer hardware to communicate with software
- Resource allocation

## Key Features of an OS:
1. Muti-User
	- Allos for mutiple users to use the same computer at the same time
2. Multi-Processing
	- Capable of supporting and utilizing more than one computer processor
3. Multi-Tasking
	- Capable of allowing multiple software processes to run at the same time

## Philosophy of UNIX

1. Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding "new features"
2. Expect the output of every program to become the input of another, as yet unknown, program. Don't clutter output with extraneous information.
3. Design and build software, even OS, to be tried early, ideally within weeks
4. Use tools in preference to unskilled help to lighten a programming task, even if you have to detour  to build the tools and expect to throw some of them out after you've finished using them
### Summary
1. Write programs that do one thing and do it well
2. Write programs to work together
3. Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface


## Open Source Software
- Source code made available with license to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone for any purpose
- Software developed in a *collaborative* and *public* manner
- People improve it, adapt it, and fix bugs

## Linux
- Free and open-source OS
- Based on UNIX operating system
- Linux kernel created in 1991 by Linux Torvalds while attending the University of Helsinki
- Has matured to a very popular OS

### Linux provides Security
Linux is largely "virus-free"
- Almost no viruses written for Linux
- Normal user accounts have limited access to rest of the system making corruption of system binaries much harder
