## Input / Output Redirection ("Piping")
Bash shell allocates 3 files descriptors for each process
- STDIN is opened for keyboard input
- STOUD, STDERR to screen output

Programs (or filters) can output to other programs (this is called Piping)

**program_1 | program_2**
- program 1's output becomes program_2;s input
**program_1 > file.txt**
- program_1's output and error logs are written to a file called "file.txt"
- We can use >> instead of > to append to end of file.txt
**program_1 < input.txt**
- program_1 gets its input from a file called "input.txt"

## Pipes and filters
A filter is a program which accepts textual input and transforms it in some way
Filters can be connected together by pipes.
Filters can be thought of as building blocks to be easily put together to do what you want
