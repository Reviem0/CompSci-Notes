## Input / Output Redirection ("Piping")
Bash shell allocates 3 files descriptors for each process
- STDIN is opened for keyboard input
- STOUD, STDERR to screen output

Programs (or filters) can output to other programs (this is called Piping)

**program_1 | program_2**
- program 1's output becomes program
