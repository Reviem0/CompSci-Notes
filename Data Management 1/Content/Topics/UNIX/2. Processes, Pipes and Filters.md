## Input / Output Redirection ("Piping")
Bash shell allocates 3 files descriptors for each process
- STDIN is opened for keyboard input
- STOUD, STDERR to screen output

Programs (or filters) can output to other programs (this is called Piping)

**program_1 | program_2**
- program 1's output becomes program_2;s input
**program_1 > file.txt**
- program_1's output and error logs are written to a file called "file.txt"
- We can use >> instead of > to append to end of
