Database: A collection of data organised in a particular way and managed by a DBMS
DBMS: Database Management System - A collection of software

## DBMS
A DBMS is a set of computer programs that support:
- at least one data model (a mathematical abstraction for representing data) to define a database and an associated high-level language to create and query the database
- ability to store and manage large amounts of persistent data
- transaction management, concurrency control
- access control
- resiliency
## Data Model
A collection (mathematical) concepts for describing data - how it is represented and structured in the database
- The relational model of data is the most widely used model today
- Every Data model has to come with a data language
	- for defining, updating, manipulating and retrieving data from its representation
A data language has two parts (**sublanguages**):
- Data Definition language (DML):
	- syntax for describing "database templates" in terms of the underlying data model
- Data manipulation language (DML)
	- for changing the data inside a database instance
	- insertion, deletion, update, retrieval/extraction/querying

## Relational Data Model
Formalism for data describing and representing data.
Formally, a relation is a subset of a cartesian product of sets
Informally, a relation can be seen as a table

## Basic Notations from Discrete Mathematics
A k-tuple is an ordered sequence of k elements
- $(2,0,1)$ is a 3-tuple; $(a,b,a,a,c)$ is a 5-tuple, and so on
If $D_{1},D_{2},\dots D_{k}$ are sets:
- then the cartesian product $D_{1} \times D_{2} \dots \times D_{k}$
- is the set of all k-
