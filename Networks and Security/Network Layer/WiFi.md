# What is Wi-Fi?
Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity) is the wireless alternative to Ethernet
**Comparison with Ethernet**:
- **Connection Type**: Wi-Fi is wireless; Ethernet is wired.
- **Speed**: Wi-Fi can go up to 9.6 Gbps, while Ethernet can reach up to 10 Gbps.
- **Security**: Wi-Fi is more vulnerable and needs strong encryption; Ethernet is more secure.

### How Wi-Fi Works
- Typically involves an **Access Point (AP)** that connects to the wired network.
    
- The AP transmits radio signals in specific frequency ranges (2.4 GHz or 5 GHz).
    
- Client devices associate with the AP to receive these signals.
    
- A **Service Set Identifier (SSID)** is used to identify a wireless network.
    
- **Ad hoc networks** allow clients to connect directly without an AP, but this is less common.
