# What is Wi-Fi?
Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity) is the wireless alternative to Ethernet
**Comparison with Ethernet**:
- **Connection Type**: Wi-Fi is wireless; Ethernet is wired.
- **Speed**: Wi-Fi can go up to 9.6 Gbps, while Ethernet can reach up to 10 Gbps.
- **Security**: Wi-Fi is more vulnerable and needs strong encryption; Ethernet is more secure.

### How Wi-Fi Works
- Typically involves an **Access Point (AP)** that connects to the wired network.
- The AP transmits radio signals in specific frequency ranges (2.4 GHz or 5 GHz).
- Client devices associate with the AP to receive these signals.
- A **Service Set Identifier (SSID)** is used to identify a wireless network.
- **Ad hoc networks** allow clients to connect directly without an AP, but this is less common.

### 2.4 GHz vs. 5 GHz Frequencies
- **2.4 GHz**:
    - Speed: Slower
    - Range: Longer
    - Interference: High (crowded)
    - Use Cases: Good for large areas and penetrating walls.
- **5 GHz**:
    - Speed: Faster
    - Range: Shorter
    - Interference: Low
    - Use Cases: Suited for high-speed, short-range communication.
