    - **Typical Attacks:** Web defacements, data breaches (leaking confidential/compromising information), DDoS.

- **Script Kiddies (Noobs):**
    - **Motivation:** Desire to join real hacker groups, the challenge itself, or curiosity.
        
    - **Characteristics:** Less skilled, use tools found on the internet without a clear strategy or methodology, but can still succeed.
