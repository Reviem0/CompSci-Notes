# Why Wi-Fi Security is Essential
Wireless networks are inherently less secure than wired ones because their signals aren't confined by cables. This means anyone within range can potentially intercept data or gain unauthorized access. The main goal of Wi-Fi security protocols is to encrypt and protect the data transmitted over these wireless networks.

# Common Wi-Fi Attacks

Several types of attacks can compromise Wi-Fi networks:
- **Eavesdropping**: Attackers can "listen in" on wireless communications if they are not properly secured. (See slide 4 for a visual representation).
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack**: An attacker intercepts communications between two parties, potentially altering them without either party knowing. (See slide 5 for an illustration).
- **Deauthentication Attack**: This attack forces Wi-Fi devices to disconnect from a network.
- **Evil Twin Attack**: An attacker sets up a rogue access point that appears to be a legitimate one to trick users into connecting, allowing the attacker to intercept data.

These vulnerabilities highlight the need for robust security mechanisms.
