# The C.I.A Triad
- **Confidentiality**: Restricting unauthorised access (e.g. encryption). 
	- Breach = unauthorised disclosure (e.g. stolen USB drive)
- **Integrity**: Ensuring data/system accuracy and trustworthiness. 
	- Breach = unauthorised modification
- **Availability**: Ensuring timely access. 
	- Breach = disruption (DDoS attack)
- Integrity Related Concepts:
	- **Authenticity**: Verifying identities / data sources
		- This means verifying that: 
			- users are who they say they are,
			- each input arriving at the system comes from a trusted source
	- **Accountability**: Tracing actions to entities
		- Systems must keep records of their activities to permit later forensic analysis to trace security breaches or to aid in transaction disputes.
