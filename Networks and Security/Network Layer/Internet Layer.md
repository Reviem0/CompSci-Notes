# Internet Layer Functions
- Internetworking: Hides routing complexity from the Transport Layer; connects heterogenous networks (LANs via routers)
- **Packet Transmission**:
	- Packetization: Data is split into IP datagrams
	- Routing: Routers use tables to determine [[Next-Hop Routing| next-hop]] paths
