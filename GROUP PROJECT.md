# The Future of AI in Decision-Making: The Irreversible Consequences of Algorithmic Bias in the Justice System

Introduction of AI into judicial systems has promising transformative benefits:
- streamlining case management
- reducing human bias

However, it's adoption introduces risks from algorithmic bias.
As AI systems increasingly influence sentencing, their reliance on historical data and vague decision-making processes risks systemic inequalities.

AI has an undeniable potential to enhance judicial efficiency.
Tools like COMPAS ( Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) analyses [recidivism](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/recidivism) risk, while predictive policing algorithms allocate law enforcement resources based on crime patterns.

Experts argue that AI can reduce human cognitive bias such as racial prejudice and [anchoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_effect) and expedite backlogged cases.

However, these systems often inherit historical biases from the training data. For example, COMPAS disproportionately labelled black defendants as high-risk. Similarly, predictive policing tools like PredPol reinforce over-policing in minority neighbourhoods by relying on arrest records.

This exemplifies how AI risks automating and potentially amplifying structural injustices.

# Causes of Algorithmic Bias
Algorithmic bias is caused by three interconnected flaws.
1. **Historical Data Flaws:** AI systems trained on decades of biased policing and sentencing data may likely embed systemic racism and socioeconomic disparities. For example, predictive policing tools interpret higher arrest rates in minority communities as indicators of criminal bias (likeliness of breaking the law) rather than over-policing.
2. **Black Box:** Many AI models, especially deep learning systems, lack transparency. Judges, defendants and even developers often cannot explain how decisions are made, undermining accountability
3. **Feedback Loops:** Biased predictions lead to targeted enforcement, generating more data that deepens the cycle.
The harm lies in how these biases become institutionalised. Once put in place, they shape policies, resource allocation and public trust.

# Ethical and Legal Challenges
The ethical implications of AI in justice are dark:
