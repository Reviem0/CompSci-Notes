# The Future of AI in Decision-Making: The Consequences of Algorithmic Bias in the Justice System

Introduction of AI into judicial systems has promising benefits:
- streamlining case management
- reducing human bias

However, it's adoption introduces risks from algorithmic bias.
As AI systems increasingly influence sentencing, their reliance on historical data and vague decision-making processes risks systemic inequalities.

AI has an undeniable potential to enhance judicial efficiency.
Tools like COMPAS ( Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) analyses [recidivism](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/recidivism) risk, while predictive policing algorithms allocate law enforcement resources based on crime patterns.

Experts argue that AI can reduce human cognitive bias such as racial prejudice and [anchoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_effect) and expedite backlogged cases.

However, these systems often inherit historical biases from the training data. For example, COMPAS disproportionately labelled black defendants as high-risk. Similarly, predictive policing tools like PredPol reinforce over-policing in minority neighbourhoods by relying on arrest records.

This exemplifies how AI risks automating and potentially amplifying structural injustices.

# Causes of Algorithmic Bias
Algorithmic bias is caused by three interconnected flaws.
1. **Historical Data Flaws:** AI systems trained on decades of biased policing and sentencing data may likely embed systemic racism and socioeconomic disparities. For example, predictive policing tools interpret higher arrest rates in minority communities as indicators of criminal bias (likeliness of breaking the law) rather than over-policing.
2. **Black Box:** Many AI models, especially deep learning systems, lack transparency. Judges, defendants and even developers often cannot explain how decisions are made, undermining accountability
3. **Feedback Loops:** Biased predictions lead to targeted enforcement, generating more data that deepens the cycle.
The harm lies in how these biases become institutionalised. Once put in place, they shape policies, resource allocation and public trust.

# Ethical and Legal Challenges
The ethical implications of AI in justice are dark:
- **Due Process Violations:** AI-driven risk assessment often lack transparency, denying defendants the right to challenge evidence. In [State v. Loomis](https://jhulr.org/2025/01/01/algorithmic-justice-or-bias-legal-implications-of-predictive-policing-algorithms-in-criminal-justice/), the Wisconsin Supreme Court upheld the use of COMPAS but warned of it's opacity, highlighting tensions between efficiency and fairness.
- **Erosion of Trust:** Communities subjected to algorithmic scrutiny may lose faith in the legitimacy of judicial decisions

# Solutions
1. **Transparency and Audits:** Mandating [algorithmic explainability](https://c3.ai/glossary/machine-learning/explainability/#:~:text=Explainability%20(also%20referred%20to%20as,being%20at%20an%20acceptable%20level.) and third-party audits can clarify AI decisions. The European Ethical Charter on AI in Judicial Systems, for instance, emphasizes accountability and human oversight
2. **Debiasing Techniques:** Methods like [adversarial debiasing](https://holisticai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/bias/mitigation/inprocessing/bc_adversarial_debiasing_adversarial_debiasing.html) and fairness-aware machine learning can reduce disparities in training data. For example, reweighting datasets to balance racial representation has shown promise in mitigating COMPAS-like biases
3.  **Human-AI Collaboration:** Keeping human judgement in sentencing and parole ensures that contextual factors, such as socioeconomic barriers, are considered. Studies show jurors weigh AI recommendations but prioritize human empathy in nuanced cases.

**Slide 1: Further Problems & Complications in Algorithmic Systems**

**Opening**  
"Hi, I’ll be discussing critical issues arising from algorithmic bias across sectors, focusing on the **justice system** and **healthcare**. These examples should highlight how even technologies developed with good intentions can perpetuate inequality if not carefully designed.

**Justice System: COMPAS Case Study**  
Let’s start with the justice system. Tools like **COMPAS**—a risk assessment algorithm used to predict recidivism—aim to reduce human bias and streamline case processing. However, COMPAS is trained on **historical arrest data**, which reflects systemic racial disparities. Studies show it disproportionately labels Black defendants as ‘high risk,’ even when they don’t reoffend. This isn’t just a technical flaw—it’s a **reinforcement of societal inequities**, affecting sentencing, parole, and lives.

**Healthcare: Diagnostic Algorithms**  
Moving to healthcare, algorithms used for diagnosing diseases like skin cancer face similar pitfalls. Many are trained on datasets **overrepresented by lighter skin tones**, leading to lower accuracy for darker-skinned patients. Imagine a delayed cancer diagnosis simply because the tool wasn’t designed for diverse populations. This isn’t hypothetical—it’s happening, worsening health disparities for marginalized groups.

**Transition to Slide 2**  
These examples show how bias in training data leads to real-world harm. Now, let’s explore how algorithms impact **social dynamics, education, and financial equity**."

**Slide 2: Algorithmic Bias in Social, Educational, and Financial Systems**

**[Social Media: Echo Chambers & Misinformation]**  
Social media platforms prioritize **engagement**, creating echo chambers. For instance, if a user interacts with polarizing content—even to criticize it—the algorithm pushes more of it. Young people, for example, might be bombarded with harmful body-image content, deepening mental health crises. This isn’t neutral curation; it’s **profit-driven design** that sacrifices societal well-being.

**[Education: Algorithmic Grading During COVID]**  
During the pandemic, automated grading systems downgraded students from **underfunded schools**, altering university admissions. These systems relied on historical data that favored privileged institutions, punishing students already disadvantaged by resource gaps.

**[Financial Services: Credit Scoring Biases]**  
Finally, financial algorithms often use proxies like **zip codes** for creditworthiness. This unfairly penalizes lower-income neighborhoods—often minority communities—denying loans or charging higher rates. It’s a digital redlining that entrenches **economic inequality**.

**[Conclusion & Call to Action]**  
From courtrooms to classrooms, algorithmic bias isn’t abstract—it’s amplifying existing inequities. Addressing this requires **diverse training data, transparency**, and policies that prioritize equity over efficiency. As future technologists and policymakers, we must ensure tools serve _all_ communities fairly.
