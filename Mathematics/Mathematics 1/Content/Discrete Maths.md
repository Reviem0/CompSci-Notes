Discrete vs Continuous
- roughly speaking
	- you can count discrete things
		- balls, people, planet, seconds, ...
	- you can deform (e.g. stretch and shrink) continuous things
		- rubber bands, routes, curves, space, time

Continuous Maths is important in physical sciences and includes:
- Physical Science
- Differential Calculus
- Topology
- Real Numbers
- Complex Numbers
Discrete Maths is important in the logical sciences (Computers handle discrete data):
- Data Structures (trees, graphs, stacks, multisets, sets...)
- The set of natural numbers
