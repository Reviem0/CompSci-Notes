# Basis
A **basis** B of a vector space V is a set of vectors that satisfies two conditions:
1. The vectors in B are **linearly independent**.
2. The vectors in B **span** the entire vector space V (i.e., span(B)=V).

A basis provides a way to uniquely write any vector in the space as a linear combination of the basis vectors.
