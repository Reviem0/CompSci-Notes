# Basis
A **basis** B of a vector space V is a set of vectors that satisfies two conditions:
1. The vectors in B are **linearly independent**.
2. The vectors in B **span** the entire vector space V (i.e., span(B)=V).

A basis provides a way to uniquely write any vector in the space as a linear combination of the basis vectors.

The **dimension** of a vector space V is the **number of vectors** in any basis for V. For example, R2 has a dimension of 2, and Rd has a dimension of d.

**Example from the lecture (checking for a basis):** $v_{1} = \begin{bmatrix}

\end{bmatrix}$
