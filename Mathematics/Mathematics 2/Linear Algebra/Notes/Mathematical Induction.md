- Purpose:
	- Mathematical induction is a proof technique used to demonstrate that a given statement $S(n)$, is true for all natural numbers (or a subset of natural numbers, e.g. $n>n_{0}$).

To prove a statement $S(n)$ is true for all positive integers $n$, you must complete two crucial steps:
1. Base Case (or Basis Step): Show that the statement $S(n)$ is true for the initial value, usually $n=1$ (or a specified starting integer $n_{0}$).
2. Inductive Step:
	- I
