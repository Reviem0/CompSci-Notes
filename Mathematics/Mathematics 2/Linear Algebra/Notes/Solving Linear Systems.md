# Linear Equation and Hyperplanes
- A linear equation is an equation where variables are only multiplied by constants and summed up. For example, $3x_{1}+2x_{2}+1x_{3}=39$
- Geometrically, a linear equation defines a **hyperplane**.
	- In 2D, a linear equation represents a line
	- In 3D, it represents a plane
- A plane can be defined by a normal vector $n$ and a point $r$
