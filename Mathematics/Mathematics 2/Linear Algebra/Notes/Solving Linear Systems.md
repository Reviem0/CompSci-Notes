# Linear Equation and Hyperplanes
- A linear equation is an equation where variables are only multiplied by constants and summed up. For example, $3x_{1}+2x_{2}+1x_{3}=39$
- Geometrically, a linear equation defines a **hyperplane**.
	- In 2D, a linear equation represents a line
	- In 3D, it represents a plane
- A plane can be defined by a normal vector $n$ and a point $r_{0}$ on a plane, using scalar product $n \cdot (r - r_{0}) = 0$. This expands to a linear equation of the form $n_{1}(x-x_{0}) + n_{2}(y-y_{0})+2_{3}(z-z_{0})=0$

# Solving Systems of Linear Equations
- A system of linear equations is a set of two or more linear equations involving the same set of variables. For example:
$$
\begin{aligned}
3x_{1}+2x_{2}+1x_{3} &=39 \\
2x_{1}+3x_{2}+1x_{3} &= 34 \\
1x_{1}+2x_{2}+3x_{3} &= 26

\end{aligned}
$$

There are three possible outcomes when solving a system:
1. Exactly one unique solution: The hyperplanes intersect at 
2. No solution: The hyperplanes are parallel and distinct
3. Infinitely many solutions: The hyperplanes overlap
